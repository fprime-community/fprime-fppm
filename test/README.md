# fppm Unit Tests

Unit testing is provided by the `pytest` framework, which can be installed locally on your system, or by closing this repository and installing the dev dependencies:

```bash
pip install fprime-fppm[dev]
```

To run tests, it is best to run `pytest` verbosely.

```bash
# example
pytest fppm-cli.py -v
```
