# fppm - A Package and Dependency Manager for F'

F Prime packages (otherwise known as [libraries](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/HowTo/develop-fprime-libraries.html)) are a way for packaging components, topologies, and/or other F Prime-related elements to prepare for distribution. `fppm` aims to be the method of delivery for these packages.
